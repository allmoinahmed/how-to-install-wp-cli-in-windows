WP-CLI Windows Installation:

I faced many problems while installing wp-cli to my windows. Recently, i found a easy installation guidance & i thought i should share it with all.

Steps:
1. Download wp-cli.phar from here: https://raw.githubusercontent.com/wp-cli/builds/gh-pages/phar/wp-cli.phar

2. Create a Folder called 'wp-cli' (or anything you want). Put the wp-cli.phar in that new folder. For Ex mine is: C:\wp-cli\wp-cli.phar . (You can place the .phar file anywhere you want)

3. When you install WP-CLI on Windows, it is recommended that you create a batch file so you can run your commands without typing the full path to the phar file.

4. Create Batch File: Open your favorite editor & create a file named 'wp.bat'. Put this code inside before you close it :

@ECHO OFF
c:/your/actual/path/to/php.exe "c:/wp-cli/wp-cli.phar" %*

"NOTE": Remember to change the php.exe file path where you installed it.

* First part is where your php.exe file is.
* Second part is where your wp-cli.phar located

SAVE & CLOSE IT.

5. Windows Path Environment Variable: Go to Windows 'Start Menu' and search 'Environment Variables' ..

6. After you open the 'Environment Variables' option, go to 'Advanced' Tab where you'll find 'Environment Variables' Button. Click to access options.

7. Select 'Path' from 'User variables for YOURUSER' & click EDIT.
In the “Edit environment variable” window for path, click “New” and type in the path to the wp.bat file we made above (if following the example directly, then that is c:\wp-cli\wp.bat). Click OK ..

8. Now go to 'System Variables' option & Select 'Path'. Click 'New' and add the wp-cli.bat location/path. Ex: C:\wp-cli .. Click OK & restart the command prompt.

Now try typing wp and you'll all the option for wp-cli.
Hope this helped a little. Thanks
